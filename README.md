### Nineteen components. Easy to use. ###

Simple Admin Template is a set of ready to use components, which can be easily used and modified to fit in your ongoing projects. What you will get are custom built components such as Charts, Messages widget, To-Do Lists, Form inputs, Progress Bars, Buttons, and many more.

All of the components are created by using HTML5, Sass, jQuery. All of the components are based on Bootstrap grid system and with that, everything will fit just great on any device.

### Want even more components? ###

Hopefully, soon there will be a PRO Version of Simple Admin Template with even more components included. Feel free to suggest for any components you want to see next.
